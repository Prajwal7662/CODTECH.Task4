# CODTECH.Task4
NAME: MAVKAR PRAJWAL VILAS
COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE
DURATION: 25 DEC 2024 TO 25 JAN 2025
MENTOR:  Neela Santhosh Kumar

Overview of the Project:

*Key Sections of the Code:
Preprocessing the Data: Handling missing values, encoding categorical columns, and scaling the features.
K-means Clustering: Using the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters, applying K-means clustering, and visualizing the results.
Hierarchical Clustering: Using the ward method for linkage, plotting the dendrogram, and forming clusters based on the tree.
DBSCAN Clustering: Applying DBSCAN and handling outliers.
Evaluation: Using the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index to evaluate the clustering performance.
Visualization: Using PCA for dimensionality reduction and plotting the clustering results.

*Explanation of Metrics:
Silhouette Score: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher score indicates better clustering.
Davies-Bouldin Index: Measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster that is most similar to it. Lower values are better.

*Final Thoughts:
You can adjust the number of clusters for K-means or the eps and min_samples parameters for DBSCAN based on your dataset's characteristics.
The PCA plots help to visually assess how well the clustering algorithms perform in lower-dimensional space.
